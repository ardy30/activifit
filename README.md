# Activifit GUI
This is a prototype of the GUI that the final version will consider. 

This project now has more than GUI so it has to be moved to either another branch or merge to master when applicable.

###Main
The main method will be called from runMVC class which translates to Model, View, and Controller.

The purpose of the class will be to have _sensitive_ data at the topmost level which is the __Model__.

__View__ is basically the GUI which is in the _gui_package_.

__Controller__ has all the actions that the program will perform, in this project they are contained in the _action_package_.

###Packages

There include actions for calling different screens and validating data.
