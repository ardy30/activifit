# Activifit
##Activity Tracker System
Developed on Java.  :shipit:

##Features

###Heartbeat
Measure the heartbeat of the subject according to the age and activity index.

###Steps
This feature will be generated with a random step generation along with with the age of the user and a preset value on how active the person is during the day.

###Temperature
Temperature will be affected mainly on how active is the user, and depending on the time of the day, a normal person varies in temperature about 0.5 celsius, being lower on the mornings and higher on the afternoon. This feature can identify if the user has any anomalies in the temperature such as (hypothermia, fever or hyperthermia). Information can be represented in celsius or fahrenheit degrees. 

###Sleep Quality
Sleep quality measurements are not standardized because there is not a “correct” way in how to measure it, therefore in this project we will measure sleep quality with three key states: REM, light and deep sleep. Monitoring the heart rate and body temperature, the product will be able to determinate in which state the user is. An algorithm will determine the quality.
